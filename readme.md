# The Graves-ey Font

A simple implementation of [Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850). We try to task of:

1) Unconditional Generation: Let the text generator just blabber random stuff. 

2) Conditional Generation: The text generator tries to write what you tell it to write.

3) Handwriting Recognition: Given a sequence of handwritting strokes, it predictes the charaters.

## 1: Unconditional Generation:

Simple GRU version implemented.

To Do:

1) ~~Integrate tensorboardX~~
2) Complex architecture
3) ~~Visualize results~~
